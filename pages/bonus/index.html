            <p class="des">Mudkip is a small, amphibious, quadrupedal Pokémon. 
                It has a blue body with a light blue underside. Mudkip has a 
                large head with a blue fin on top and a light-blue tail fin. It 
                has black, beady eyes and orange, star-shaped gills on its cheeks.
                By using the fin on its head, Mudkip can detect changes in air 
                and water currents as well as bodies of water. Its fin can also 
                point in a certain direction, as seen in the anime. Despite its 
                small size, Mudkip is a very strong Pokémon. Mudkip is capable of 
                moving or crushing boulders larger than itself. Its large tail fin 
                provides powerful acceleration to propel it through the water. 
                According to its Pokémon Ranger browser entry, Mudkip is a very 
                docile Pokémon. Mudkip is more commonly found in captivity, though 
                it can be found in swamps and other wetlands. In the wild, it sleeps 
                by burying itself in the mud soil at the water's edge or bottom of 
                a river. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of 
                Blueberry Academy.
