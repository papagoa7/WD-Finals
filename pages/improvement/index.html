        <p>Before learning HTML, CSS, and Java Script, I have looked at websites as they are pages with contents.
            Now I've learned a lot about websites and what they are capable of, I have opened up my creativity.
            I realized a lot about designing, and developing websites. I saw a new way of design thinking and reliability.
            Thanks to Web Design with an an amazing professor that has helped our section to be a true developer.
